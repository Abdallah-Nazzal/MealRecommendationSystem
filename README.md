Description:

‘From Fridge To Table’ Meal recommender system, is a simple recommendation system that allows you to enter a list of ingredients you have, and the system shall view a list of meals for you that match your ingredients. The recommendation part is dependable on the rating of each user. So each user will be having different results than the other. 

Motivation:

Cooking is a hobby for lots of people. However, many other people consider it as a major problem in their lives. Students struggle with this too much, most of the time they don’t know what to cook for dinner or they have a limited set of items. This inspired us to create such a system that would be so helpful for them and for other people who don't like cooking, which can recommend meals based on the ingredients they have and food they love. 

Data:

 All data is stored on a Google Drive at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1a3Nxrxf2UAoDdS2YfncKP8l6my8VsVrq?fbclid=IwAR0PwKXS2MErS5VnRT2D73mQFyVIGhQ95JpcmarSVFSdjtjsFQJ6CaPkW3Q. The dataset consists of almost 30,000 meals with almost 11,000 ingredients as features. Through feature-engineering, we’ve edited on the data so that it has the total-cook-time, the user rating and the user ID added as new features, beside the ingredients. This new version of data is meant to be our training dataset.
